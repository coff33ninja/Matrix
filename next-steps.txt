üîç Missing or Incomplete Features
1. Template Variables in Generated Files
The wiring guide (wiring_guide_esp32_16x16.md) contains unresolved template variables:

{power_req['total_leds']}
{power_req['total_current_amps']:.2f}A
{psu} and {self.power_supplies[psu]['current']}
{power_req['safety_margin_percent']}%
This suggests the wiring diagram generator isn't properly filling in calculated values.

2. Missing Dependencies
Several Python packages aren't installed in the current environment:

psutil (for system monitoring)
pyserial (for Arduino communication)
requests (for web API calls)
3. Mobile/Responsive Interface
While the project has web interfaces, there's no mention of:

Mobile app (mentioned as "planned feature")
Touch-friendly controls for tablets/phones
Responsive design optimization for small screens
4. Advanced Features Listed as "Future Enhancements"
MQTT integration for smart home compatibility
Audio visualization and music-reactive effects
Machine learning AI-generated patterns
Multi-matrix sync for synchronized displays
Community features like design sharing and contests
5. Hardware Testing & Validation
No automated hardware-in-the-loop testing
Missing validation for different Arduino board variants
No power consumption verification tests
Limited real-world hardware compatibility testing
6. Documentation Gaps
Missing video tutorials (mentioned but not implemented)
No interactive troubleshooting wizard
Limited beginner-friendly setup guides
Missing performance benchmarking documentation
7. Error Handling & Recovery
While there's basic error handling, some areas could be improved:

Better recovery from serial communication failures
More graceful handling of web server crashes
Improved validation of user input in web interfaces
8. Security Features
No authentication for web interfaces
Missing HTTPS support for remote access
No rate limiting on API endpoints
Basic input validation could be strengthened
9. Performance Optimization
No caching for frequently generated Arduino code
Missing optimization for large matrix sizes (64x64+)
No frame rate optimization for animations
Limited memory usage optimization for ESP32
10. Integration Features
Home Assistant integration
Discord/Slack bots for remote control
REST API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
Webhook support for external triggers
