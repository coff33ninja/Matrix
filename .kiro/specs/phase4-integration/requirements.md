# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Phase 4 Integration focuses on unifying the web server architecture to serve both the control interface and documentation sites through a single entry point, adding seamless navigation between them, and updating the main project README to reflect the new integrated structure. This will provide users with a cohesive experience when accessing both the real-time control features and comprehensive documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access both the control interface and documentation through a unified web server, so that I have a single entry point for all web-based functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts the web server THEN the system SHALL serve both control and documentation sites from a single server instance
2. WHEN the user accesses the root URL THEN the system SHALL provide navigation options to both control and documentation interfaces
3. WHEN the user requests the control interface THEN the system SHALL serve the control site at `/control` path
4. WHEN the user requests the documentation THEN the system SHALL serve the documentation site at `/docs` path
5. IF the user accesses an invalid path THEN the system SHALL redirect to the main navigation page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless navigation between the control interface and documentation, so that I can easily switch between controlling my matrix and reading documentation without losing context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is on the control interface THEN the system SHALL display a navigation link to the documentation
2. WHEN the user is on the documentation site THEN the system SHALL display a navigation link to the control interface
3. WHEN the user clicks a navigation link THEN the system SHALL open the target interface in the same browser window
4. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling and branding across both interfaces
5. WHEN the user navigates between interfaces THEN the system SHALL preserve any active connections or states where possible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the main project README to accurately reflect the new integrated web architecture, so that I understand how to use the unified system and what features are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user reads the main README THEN the system SHALL document the unified web server startup commands
2. WHEN the user follows the README instructions THEN the system SHALL provide clear examples of accessing both interfaces
3. WHEN the user reviews the architecture section THEN the system SHALL show the updated file structure with integrated web serving
4. WHEN the user looks for quick start instructions THEN the system SHALL provide updated commands that reflect the new unified approach
5. IF the user needs troubleshooting help THEN the system SHALL include updated troubleshooting information for the integrated architecture

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web server code to be maintainable and extensible, so that future enhancements can be easily added without breaking the integrated architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web server starts THEN the system SHALL use a modular architecture that separates routing, serving, and configuration concerns
2. WHEN new sites need to be added THEN the system SHALL support easy extension through configuration rather than code changes
3. WHEN the server handles requests THEN the system SHALL use consistent error handling and logging across all routes
4. WHEN serving static files THEN the system SHALL properly handle MIME types and caching headers for optimal performance
5. IF configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading without requiring server restart
